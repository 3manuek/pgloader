Description: extract, transform and load data into PostgreSQL
 pgloader imports data from different kind of sources and COPY it into
 PostgreSQL.
 .
 The command language is described in the manual page and allows to describe
 where to find the data source, its format, and to describe data processing
 and transformation.
 .
 Supported source formats include CSV, fixed width flat files, dBase3 files
 (DBF), and SQLite and MySQL databases. In most of those formats, pgloader
 is able to auto-discover the schema and create the tables and the indexes
 in PostgreSQL. In the MySQL case it's possible to edit CASTing rules from
 the pgloader command directly.
