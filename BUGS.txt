== Error reporting on last line when alone in its buffer

When last line is alone on a +COPY+ command and its parsing ends in
error (not enough columns read for example), no information is given
back by +pgloader+.

== Multi-line without quoting

Status::
    Appeared while preparing +2.3.0+, fixed in +~dev+ cycle (release
    candidate), not exposed to stable releases.

Details::
    The new Reader._getopt() facility forgot to consider option types,
    which was a pretty bad idea for TextReader.field_count option.

The +cluttered+ example seems to be broken, I just realized this is
the case, don't know yet how long it's been the case.
